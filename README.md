Approach:

#1. We will first explore the data with some descirptive analysis and then use some visualizations to get an initial understanding of the data. 
    * Features of Wine Class 1
        * On average Wine Class 1 has a greater dilution,alchol contnent, ash,color intensity, flavanoids, hue, magnesiu, proanthocyanins, proline, and total_phenols.
    * Features of Wine Clas 2
        * On average Wine Class 2 has a lower alcalinity_of_ash, malic_acid,and nonflavanoid_phenols.
    * Visualizations
        * I created a scatter matrix plot showing every relationship in our training dataset. 
        * One finidng I can discern from the visualization is that in a K-Nearest neighbor approach K should be low as the boundary zones between classes where very distinct. 
        The findings that showed the most promise was the realationship between
